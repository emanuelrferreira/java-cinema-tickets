# Java - Cinema Tickets

A simple Java mini-program created to practice object-oriented programming, user input, and basic calculations. 
This exercise simulates a cinema ticket system where the user selects seat types, quantities, and the program returns the total cost.

## Academic Context
This mini-project was developed for Java practice as part of my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Software Development) @ NCI, Ireland.
It represents one of the hands-on exercises used to strengthen Java fundamentals.

## Features
- User input using Scanner
- Conditional logic for pricing
- Basic calculations
- Clean console output

## Purpose
This project is part of my Java learning journey and serves as practice for small, focused exercises.
